  renderBlock - Dynamically renders a single component based on _bookshop_name

  Usage:
    {% bookshop_include "renderBlock" blocks: myBlock %}

  The block must have a _bookshop_name property containing the component path.
  Example: block._bookshop_name = "building-blocks/core-elements/heading"

{%- if block._bookshop_name -%}
  {% bookshop "{{block._bookshop_name}}" bind: block %}
{%- endif -%}
